            MARIA MONTESSORI | PLAYWAY METHOD | WE FOLLOW NEP 2020 AND NCF POLICY
        </h3>
          <p align="left">
            <b>Maria Montessori</b> approach to education was deeply rooted in her observations of children's behavior and development.
            She believed that children possessed an innate desire to learn and explore their environment, and that the role of education should be to support and nurture this natural curiosity.
            Central to the Montessori Method is the concept of the prepared environment.
            Montessori classrooms are carefully designed to encourage independence, freedom of movement, and exploration. Materials are arranged in an orderly manner and are accessible to children at all times.
            These materials are specifically designed to be self-correcting, allowing children to learn through hands-on exploration and discovery.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
            <b>Playway method</b> is a complete package that enables overall development of child along with the knowledge by doing various hands on activities.
            Playway method is nothing other then traditional way of teaching.
